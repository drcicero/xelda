XELDAS SAGA

Once upon the time princess Xelda was born. Happily she lived her life until...
One day she met the magician Nonag. To defeat death, he had turned himself into an foul creature. Now he was looking for a kingdom to rule in his evil ways.
Nonag turned the sky pitch black, kidnapped Xelda and watched the confused people and the king until it was time for him to take over the kingdom.
Suddenly a boy wearing green from head to toe appeared and defeated him.
And they may or may not have lived happily ever after (depending on circumstances).

Although the GREEN ONE was able to weaken Nonag, it was not in his power to end the tragedy.
Princess Xelda gathered the wisest men around her, and together they banished Nonag to the moon.
Every twenty Years the spell will have to be renewed by the ancestors of the Princess.
However, when the spell breaks, the time will come for a new Hero...
